# GapMinder World Data Investigation
### by Mayssa Soussia


## Dataset Description

The data we used in this project is [**the Gapminder World dataset**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub). We chose three metrics as follows: 
- *Metric 1*: Life expectancy in years. 
- *Metric 2*: The consumption of sugar in grams per person daily.
- *Metric 3*: Happiness score: this is a response to the question of a ladder with steps numbered from 0 to 10 where people were asked to answer on which step they are standing. 

The data includes three tables, each table representing a specific metric, its evolution over years for a given number of countries. 
**Column names:** 
- *country* : represents the column of the different countries (The number of countries lies between 163 and 206). 
- *year* : In addition to the country column, each table contains as many columns as the number of given years (e.g. for the life expectancy table, the years are between 1800 and 2100 while for the happiness score table, they are between 2005 and 2019)   


## Questions for Analysis
- **Question 1**: Have certain regions of the world been growing in life expectancy metric better than others ? 

- **Question 2**: Is there any relationship between life expectancy metric and happiness score/ sugar consumption metrics ?
